# Correlation & Regression Analysis in Quantitative Research Using R
- Class: Quantitative Research Methods
- Semester: Summer 2025

@voice[ukMale]{Welcome to the lecture on Correlation and Regression Analysis in Quantitative Research Using R. In this session, we will explore statistical tools used to understand relationships between variables and make predictions based on data. Letâ€™s begin.}

## Objectives of the Lecture

@voice[ukMale]{
In this lecture, our goals are to understand the concept of correlation and its applications, 
learn how to compute and interpret correlation coefficients, 
explore the basics of regression analysis and its assumptions, 
understand how to build and interpret regression models, 
and discuss the limitations and practical considerations of these methods.

## Correlation

@voice[ukMale]{
Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. 
It indicates how closely the variables with a linear relationship are associated.

Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to assess the **strength and direction** of the relationship between two variables.  
It indicates how closely the variables with a **linear relationship** are associated.

## When to Use Correlation Statistical Analysis

@voice[ukMale]{
Correlation analysis is used to assess the strength and direction of a relationship between two quantitative variables. 
It is commonly used before conducting regression analysis to identify potential predictors. 
It also plays an important role in exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns.

## Conditions for Correlation Statistical Analysis

@voice[ukMale]{
To use correlation analysis effectively, certain conditions should be met. 
First, both variables must be quantitative. 
Second, the relationship should be approximately linear. 
Third, the data should follow a normal distribution if you are using Pearson correlation. 
Fourth, outliers should be avoided as they can distort the results. 
Lastly, observations should be independent.
}

- **Quantitative Variables**: Both variables must be numeric.
- **Linearity**: The relationship between variables should be approximately linear.
- **Normality**: Data should follow a normal distribution (for Pearson correlation).
- **No Outliers**: Outliers can distort the correlation coefficient.
- **Independent Observations**: Data points should not be influenced by each other.
