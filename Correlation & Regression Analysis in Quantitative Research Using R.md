!?[UK male voice will narrate this slide](https://www.text-to-speech.biz/Text-to-Speech.mp3)

- Understand the concept of correlation and its applications.
- Learn how to compute and interpret correlation coefficients.
- Explore the basics of regression analysis and its assumptions.
- Understand how to build and interpret regression models.
- Discuss the limitations and practical considerations of these methods.

## Correlation

!?[UK male voice will narrate this slide](https://www.text-to-speech.biz/Text-to-Speech.mp3)

Correlation analysis is a statistical method used to assess the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. It indicates how closely the variables with a linear relationship are associated.

### Key Points:

- Ranges from -1 to +1
- Positive values indicate a positive relationship
- Negative values indicate a negative relationship
- Values closer to Â±1 indicate stronger relationships
- Value of 0 indicates no linear relationship

## When to Use Correlation Statistical Analysis

!?[UK male voice will narrate this slide](https://www.text-to-speech.biz/Text-to-Speech.mp3)

Correlation analysis is appropriate in the following scenarios:

- To assess the strength and direction of a relationship between two quantitative variables.
- Before conducting regression analysis to identify potential predictors.
- In exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns.

## Conditions for Correlation Statistical Analysis

For valid correlation analysis, these conditions should be met:

1. **Quantitative Variables**: Both variables must be numeric.
2. **Linearity**: The relationship between variables should be approximately linear.
3. **Normality**: Data should follow a normal distribution (for Pearson correlation).
4. **No Outliers**: Outliers can distort the correlation coefficient.
5. **Independent Observations**: Data points should not be influenced by each other.
